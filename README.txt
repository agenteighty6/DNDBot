DNDBot v0.0.1

The end goal of this project is to create a bot that allows users to play D&D entirely through Discord.  

Programmed in C# using Discord.Net.

Main planned features:
Dice rolls (of arbitrary size and quantity).
Character tracking (including assistance in filling out character sheets).
Macros (rolling with automatic modifiers based on character stats).
